	<p>In a scathing column after India's loss to eventual champions England, Vaughan called the Indian team the 'biggest underperforming' unit in the history of world cricket.</p>
	<p>Vaughan wrote that India has achieved absolutely nothing since winning the ODI World Cup at home in 2011 and has been the most under-performing white-ball team in the history.</p>
